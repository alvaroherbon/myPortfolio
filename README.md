# myPortfolio

## Information

This portfolio was made with Angular and it englobes different projects I am currently working on, including backend and frontend aspects. 
Furthermore, this was a good practice to learn Angular and incorporate it with Firebase and its different tools. 
I hope you find useful my different projects and feel free to use them in your own projects as a reference.
